        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Being students, many of us share the common difficulties growing up.
          These common difficulties could be:
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>Lack of communication between teachers and students</li>

        <li>Unable to access or lack of learning resources</li>

        <li>Relationship with friends and other students</li>

        <li>Bullying</li>

        <li>Organization, such as planning due dates, scheduling etc.</li>

        <li>Lack of communication between teachers and students</li>

        <li>Mental health problems</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          The main goal we had in mind in developing this app is to improve the
          quality of life for students. The needs and wants of a student's
          matter. Fulfilling these needs and wants can drastically enhance
          student experience and learning. The app is an educational tool that
          incorporates a better canvas, social functions, student collaboration,
          wellbeing, and many more so students can live their best educational
          lives without worries.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The motivation for our app has come from many unique needs and wants
          that all of us shared. Like the ability to easily schedule meetings or
          activities with your group, easily find great study areas to meet up
          in and even find wonderful places to eat plus many more
          quality-of-life things we wanted. The most important part for us was
          that this needed to be in one app, we wanted to make the ultimate
          education app for everyone to use.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <br />
        <li class="project-li">
          Search for your school (primary school, high school, university, Tafe,
          college etc.)
        </li>
        <br />
        <p>
          To access the app, students should search for their school. This
          feature may be separated into level of education before allowing
          students to select their institution. Like many software we currently
          use as part of education, students (and staff) will be required to
          verify their education status to ensure the application is restricted
          to use by its intended audience, free from interference from those
          outside of it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li class="project-li">
          ^^^App registers you into your chosen subjects. E.g., Introduction to
          IT
        </li>
        <li class="project-li">Accessing live classes</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          The app should be compatible with services such as microsoft teams or
          collaborate ultra so that students can attend virtual classes –
          tutorials, lectorials, practicals and workshops. This feature of the
          app would be great for students on the run, maybe having clashes in
          their timetable or an unexpected work schedule; they can join the
          class from the comfort of their phone. A phone will limit
          participation in the actual class work, but we cannot dismiss
          attendance as a key factor of students’ education. This being said,
          there can be an additional feature which will record attendance of
          students for teachers, highlighting roughly how much of a single class
          they attended as well as their participation in the chat.
          <br />

        <br />
        <li class="project-li">
          Calendar to schedule meetings, mark dates for deadlines or plan your
          days
        </li>
        <br />
        <p>
          The most difficult part for us when working together was finding the
          best time to have meetings. Everyone was always busy so there were
          very select timeslots we could have them in. And we needed to have
          constant and clear communication to organize these meetings. If we had
          access to everyone’s schedules, we could have easily found a time that
          suited everybody. We then discussed how it would also have been
          extremely helpful if we could connect these schedules to our
          university courses so we could all see when each other's classes were.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li class="project-li">Making friends</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          We also wanted a way for students to easily find places to eat, talk
          with each other, and meet after classes. We wanted this to be easy to
          use and easy to understand. It also needed to be easily accessible
          otherwise people could not use it on the go, and it needed to be on
          something that people use every single day. So, we decided that an app
          on phones and computers would be the best and most convenient choice
          for everyone. We wanted to create something that helps all students
          whether it is as small as finding a place to eat or as big as
          organizing their work and schedules to be more efficient. It would be
          the one app that all students need to improve their schooling
          experience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li class="project-li">Clubs & societies</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          Part of the university experience involves immersing yourself in its
          culture; there are hundreds of clubs and societies to accommodate any
          student. Participating in such a community allows you to obtain the
          knowledge, skills and experience in areas such as leadership,
          communication and problem-solving. If you apply for membership in a
          specialized role, for example a secretary, you can build important
          skills in finance, public speaking, group development and management.
          Providing students with a feature dedicated to clubs and societies
          will encourage participation in the school environment, and for some
          even unlock a whole new aspect of education that they would usually
          look past and never consider.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li class="project-li">More organized assessment system</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          We also wanted to do something that would clearly outline what work we
          needed to do and organize times that we could work on assignments,
          this would help to organize our workflow and improve our productivity.
          We also thought that we should create something that could be helpful
          to busy students to help organize themselves a bit better. We thought
          that if we found a way to display all the assessment tasks and the
          module work in a clearer and simpler system that would break them up
          into smaller tasks, it would make all the course work seem far less
          intimidating for everyone. The app should include a feature allowing
          students to search for classes and assignments, as well as a clear and
          simple way to upload files/notes to assist other peers. With this,
          students should also be able to submit assignments through the app by
          connecting to other cloud spaces such as google drive, OneDrive and
          any other services they may have used to complete their work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li class="project-li">Study spaces</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          We discussed how difficult it was to find a great study spot for group
          work that we needed to do in person with other classes. We would walk
          around for ages trying to find a study area that was not crowded, or
          we could not decide the best spot that had the least amount of
          distractions, So we wanted to make that process far easier for
          everyone, and we also did not want to be limited to study areas that
          are at RMIT, we wanted to be able to find spots all throughout
          Melbourne so that people could find a study area closer to where they
          live.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li class="project-li">Locating teachers</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          In this app will be a feature to locate teachers and other staff. How
          often students go onto the ‘teaching team’ tab on canvas, yet they
          cannot find an email or even name for their lecturers or tutors.
          Making available a point of contact between teachers and students will
          most definitely improve the learning environment. The most significant
          aspect in student engagement and involvement is frequent
          student-teacher contact both within and outside of the class. Teachers
          can also be a point of support for students, whether it is related to
          work, conflicts with other peers, or for help with personal aspects of
          their life. Knowing a few teachers well increases a student’s
          dedication to their education, encouraging them to consider their
          personal values as well as future ambitions. Prompt contact with an
          instructor itself has been proven to be a key factor in fruitful and
          impactful learning. In saying this, the app should also include
          security measures, or even punishment systems, in place to protect
          teachers so that their contact details will not be abused.

        <h2>Tools & Tech</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In order to make this functional we need to use tools. The tools
          needed are Proto.io which is software designed to help coders build,
          share and test interactive prototypes for any size device. This is
          important for our software as users will be coming from many different
          devices and needs to be consistent across the board. We will also need
          other software such as a coding platform which could be Atom or VS
          Code depending on the user preference which will help write the code.
          This will allow for a seamless and organized experience when creating
          the software, which is essential when working in teams. Other elements
          that could be used as well would be bootstrap and GitHub. This allows
          people to work on the project at the same time allowing for different
          branches to be formed to see if certain features would be better
          implemented in the program.

      <div class="skills">
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Design skills such as CSS an UI/UX skills will be needed for the app.
          It must look nice as customers don’t want apps that look boring. The
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) help change font colours and backgrounds.
          The app must be user friendly in terms of design and contain nice
          colours and images. Coding skills such as html skills will be required
          to create this project. Github skills such as creating repository will
          be required for the app to launch to be available for everyone. The
          HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) helps web and app designers
          manufacture their project. The HTML and CSS skills together also help
          modify images to suit different device platforms. Communication skills
          will be required as it helps us communicate with the clients to follow
          their needs and wants. The communication skills will help us set tasks
          for each team member and report any faults during the process for the
          team to solve.

      <div class="outcome">
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The outcome of our project will better quality of life for students.
          It will help the organization app to help students keep on track. It
          will also help students make new friends and it will help them develop
          social skills for the future. It saves time for students and teachers
          as I noticed it took over 3 weeks for groups to form for assignments.
          After this app has been created, forming groups would take less than a
          week and teachers and students can start assignments quicker. It will
          also help students on campus and off campus as they can locate their
          teachers by email or by a registered room. This will save first year
          university students a huge hassle and everyone else in the university
          systems. It will also prepare students for the real-life workforces as
          this app has an assignment deadline task splitter feature and a club's
          feature that helps students contribute to communities.
